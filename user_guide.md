# SecureKB: User Guide

This guide provides instructions for using the SecureKB system to query your organization's knowledge base with role-based access control.

## Introduction

SecureKB is a solution that provides role-based access control for Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases. It ensures that users can only access information appropriate to their roles and clearance levels.

## Getting Started

### Accessing the System

1. Open the SecureKB web interface at the URL provided by your administrator
2. Log in with your username and password
3. The system will automatically detect your role and clearance level

### User Interface Overview

The SecureKB interface consists of the following components:

1. **Query Input**: A text area where you can enter your questions
2. **Results Display**: Shows the responses to your queries
3. **User Information**: Displays your current role and clearance level
4. **Navigation**: Allows you to access different features of the system

## Querying the Knowledge Base

### Basic Queries

To query the knowledge base:

1. Enter your question in the query input field
2. Click the "Submit Query" button
3. View the results in the results display area

Example queries:
- "What are our sales targets for this quarter?"
- "What is our leave policy?"
- "How is our financial performance this year?"

### Understanding Results

Each result includes:

1. **Content**: The information that answers your query
2. **Metadata**: Tags showing the department and sensitivity level
3. **Relevance**: How closely the result matches your query

### Role-Based Access

The system filters results based on your role:

1. **Department Access**: You can only see information tagged for your department or marked as public
2. **Clearance Level**: You can only see information at or below your clearance level

Clearance levels, from lowest to highest:
- Public
- Internal
- Confidential
- Restricted

## Tips for Effective Queries

1. **Be Specific**: Ask clear, specific questions
2. **Use Keywords**: Include relevant keywords related to your department
3. **Refine Queries**: If you don't get the expected results, try rephrasing your question
4. **Check Metadata**: Look at the metadata tags to understand why certain information is shown to you

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **No Results**: If your query returns no results, try:
   - Using different keywords
   - Broadening your question
   - Checking that you're asking about information your role has access to

2. **Unexpected Results**: If you receive unexpected results, consider:
   - Whether the information is correctly tagged
   - If your query might be ambiguous
   - Whether you need a higher clearance level for the information you're seeking

3. **Access Denied**: If you need access to information outside your current permissions:
   - Contact your administrator to request a role or clearance level change
   - Ask a colleague with appropriate access to share the information through proper channels

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues with the system:

1. Contact your system administrator
2. Check the internal knowledge base for FAQs
3. Report any technical issues through the support channel

## Security Best Practices

1. **Never share your login credentials**
2. **Log out when you're done using the system**
3. **Don't attempt to access information beyond your clearance level**
4. **Report any security concerns immediately**

## Privacy and Compliance

SecureKB is designed to enforce your organization's data access policies. All queries and access attempts are logged for audit purposes. This helps ensure compliance with internal policies and external regulations.
