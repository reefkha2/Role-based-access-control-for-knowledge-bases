## Test Users

We've created the following test users with different roles:

3. **Finance User**: Department: finance, Clearance Level: confidential
4. **Executive User**: Department: executive, Clearance Level: restricted
5. **Public User**: Department: public, Clearance Level: public

## Testing Results

We've tested the solution with different user roles and queries, and the results demonstrate that the role-based access control is working as expected:

1. **Query: What are our financial projections?**
   - Sales User: Sees only general financial information
   - Finance User: Sees detailed financial information
   - Executive User: Sees all financial information including restricted information

2. **Query: What are our HR policies?**
   - Public User: Sees only public HR policies
   - HR User: Sees all HR policies including confidential information

3. **Query: What are our acquisition plans?**
   - Sales User: Does not see acquisition information
   - Finance User: Does not see acquisition information
   - Executive User: Sees detailed acquisition plans

## Conclusion

The SecureKB solution has been successfully deployed and tested. It demonstrates the power of chunk-level access control, allowing organizations to maintain a single knowledge base while ensuring appropriate access controls based on user roles and clearance levels.

The solution is ready for use and can be extended with additional features such as a web UI, more sophisticated document chunking strategies, and audit logging for access tracking.
