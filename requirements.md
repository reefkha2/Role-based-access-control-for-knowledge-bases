# SecureKB: Requirements

This document outlines the requirements for SecureKB, a solution for implementing role-based access control in Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases.

## Functional Requirements

### Document Processing and Metadata Tagging

1. **Chunk-Level Classification**
   - The system must analyze and classify each document chunk during ingestion
   - Classification must determine appropriate department access (e.g., Sales, HR, Finance)
   - Classification must assign a sensitivity level (e.g., Public, Internal, Confidential, Restricted)

2. **LLM-Based Classification**
   - The system must use an LLM to perform intelligent classification of chunks
   - The LLM must analyze both the chunk content and the full document context
   - The system must handle classification failures gracefully with default secure settings

3. **Metadata Storage**
   - All chunks must be stored with appropriate metadata tags
   - Metadata must include at minimum: department(s) and sensitivity level
   - The system must support multi-value department tags (e.g., a chunk accessible to both Sales and Marketing)

### User Authentication and Role Management

1. **User Authentication**
   - The system must integrate with Amazon Cognito for user authentication
   - The system must support federation with enterprise identity providers

2. **Role Assignment**
   - Users must be assignable to one or more departments/roles
   - The system must support hierarchical roles (e.g., managers can access their team's data)
   - Role information must be retrievable during query processing

### Query Processing with Access Control

1. **Dynamic Filter Generation**
   - The system must generate appropriate filters based on user roles
   - Filters must be applied to all Knowledge Base queries
   - The system must support complex filter combinations for users with multiple roles

2. **Response Filtering**
   - Only chunks matching the user's access permissions must be included in responses
   - The system must maintain context coherence even when some chunks are filtered out
   - The system must handle empty result sets gracefully

3. **Audit Logging**
   - All access attempts must be logged
   - Logs must include user identity, query, and access permissions applied
   - The system must detect and alert on potential unauthorized access attempts

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance**
   - Metadata filtering must not significantly impact query response time (<200ms overhead)
   - Document processing with LLM classification must complete within reasonable time frames

2. **Scalability**
   - The solution must scale to support large document collections (millions of chunks)
   - The solution must handle concurrent queries from many users

3. **Security**
   - The system must implement defense in depth with multiple security controls
   - All communications must be encrypted in transit
   - Authentication tokens must be securely handled

4. **Maintainability**
   - The solution must be implemented as infrastructure as code
   - Components must be loosely coupled for easier updates
   - The system must include comprehensive logging and monitoring

5. **Compliance**
   - The solution must support audit requirements for access control
   - The implementation must follow AWS security best practices

## User Stories

1. As an administrator, I want to ingest documents with automatic classification so that appropriate access controls are applied without manual tagging.

2. As a sales user, I want to query the knowledge base and receive only sales-related information so that I don't see HR or finance data I shouldn't access.

3. As an HR manager, I want to access both general HR information and sensitive personnel data so that I can perform my job functions.

4. As a compliance officer, I want to audit who has accessed what information so that I can ensure proper data governance.

5. As a system administrator, I want to configure role mappings so that I can adjust access controls as organizational structures change.
