# SecureKB Project Summary

## Project Overview

SecureKB is a secure knowledge base solution that implements role-based access control at the chunk level. The system allows organizations to maintain a single knowledge base while ensuring appropriate access controls by classifying individual chunks of documents with department and sensitivity metadata.

## Implemented Components

1. **Lambda Functions**:
   - Document Processor: Splits documents into chunks
   - Metadata Tagger: Classifies chunks with department and sensitivity metadata
   - Query Processor: Filters query results based on user's role and clearance level

2. **Storage**:
   - Document Bucket: Stores original documents
   - Processed Chunks Bucket: Stores classified chunks

3. **Authentication**:
   - Cognito User Pool: Manages users and their attributes (department, clearance level)

4. **API**:
   - API Gateway: Provides secure access to the query endpoint

5. **AI/ML**:
   - Amazon Bedrock: Used for document classification and query processing

## Testing and Validation

We've created several test scripts to validate the functionality:

1. `test_document_processor.py`: Tests the document chunking functionality
2. `test_metadata_tagger.py`: Tests the chunk classification functionality
3. `test_query_processor.py`: Tests the query filtering functionality
4. `test_query.py`: End-to-end test for querying with different user roles

## Deployment

The solution can be deployed using:

1. `deploy_with_cli.sh`: Creates all necessary AWS resources
2. `upload_sample_documents.py`: Uploads sample documents with mixed content
3. `create_test_users.py`: Creates test users with different roles

## Documentation

We've created comprehensive documentation:

1. `README.md`: Overview of the project, features, and usage instructions
2. `demo_script.md`: Script for demonstrating the solution
3. Architecture diagram: Visual representation of the system components

## Key Innovations

1. **Chunk-level access control**: Instead of restricting access at the document level, SecureKB implements access control at the chunk level, allowing for more granular security.

2. **Automatic classification**: Uses AI to automatically classify document chunks with appropriate metadata.

3. **Role-based filtering**: Queries are filtered based on the user's department and clearance level, ensuring they only see information appropriate for their role.

## Future Enhancements

1. Add a web UI for document upload and querying
2. Implement more sophisticated document chunking strategies
3. Add support for more document formats
4. Implement audit logging for access tracking
5. Add support for document versioning and history
