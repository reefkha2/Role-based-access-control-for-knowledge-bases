# SecureKB: Test Plan

This document outlines the testing strategy for SecureKB, a solution for implementing role-based access control in Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases.

## Unit Testing

### Document Processor Lambda

- Test document retrieval from S3
- Test text extraction from various document formats
- Test chunking logic with different document types
- Test context preservation across chunks
- Test error handling for malformed documents

### Metadata Tagger Lambda

- Test LLM integration for classification
- Test prompt effectiveness with various content types
- Test metadata application logic
- Test error handling and default classifications
- Test performance with large documents

### Query Processor Lambda

- Test user role extraction
- Test filter generation for various role combinations
- Test Knowledge Base query integration
- Test response processing and formatting
- Test audit logging functionality

## Integration Testing

### End-to-End Document Processing

- Test complete document ingestion pipeline
- Verify metadata is correctly applied to chunks
- Test with various document types and formats
- Verify document context is preserved
- Test concurrent document processing

### End-to-End Query Processing

- Test authentication flow
- Test query processing with role-based filtering
- Verify only authorized content is returned
- Test with users having multiple roles
- Test with various query complexities

## Security Testing

### Authentication and Authorization

- Test token validation
- Test role-based access controls
- Test for authentication bypass vulnerabilities
- Test session management
- Test federation with identity providers

### Data Protection

- Verify encryption in transit
- Verify encryption at rest
- Test for sensitive information leakage
- Verify proper handling of authentication tokens
- Test audit logging effectiveness

### Access Control Verification

- Test that users cannot access unauthorized content
- Test boundary conditions in access control logic
- Test for filter bypass vulnerabilities
- Test hierarchical role access
- Test for metadata manipulation vulnerabilities

## Performance Testing

### Document Processing Performance

- Test processing time for various document sizes
- Test concurrent document processing
- Test LLM classification performance
- Test system behavior under heavy ingestion load

### Query Performance

- Test query response time with filters
- Test query performance with large knowledge bases
- Test concurrent query handling
- Test system behavior under heavy query load

## Test Data

### Test Documents

- Create sample documents with mixed sensitivity content
- Include documents relevant to different departments
- Create documents with complex structures
- Include documents with various formats (PDF, Word, text)

### Test Users

- Create users with different single roles
- Create users with multiple roles
- Create users with hierarchical roles
- Create users with different clearance levels

## Test Environments

### Development Environment

- Local testing of Lambda functions
- Mocked AWS services
- Unit test execution

### Test Environment

- Deployed AWS infrastructure
- Isolated from production data
- Integration and performance testing

## Test Automation
